# Game Idea 2 (RPG)

A simple tick based game where you choose where to move every tick. Dungeon crawler-like.

Each tick a player can move any direction. If they finish the tick on a mine, they get 1 gold. If they finish a tick on a upgrade space, they upgrade that skill. If they end a turn on another player, they do damage.
